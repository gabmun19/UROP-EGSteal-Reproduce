# EGSteal - Reproduction Repository

Reproducing: Ma, Bin, et al. “How Explanations Leak the Decision Logic: Stealing Graph Neural Networks via Explanation Alignment.” ArXiv (Cornell University), 3 June 2025, https://doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2506.03087.

This repository contains my reproduction work for the EGSteal project in which I am working on through Florida State University's Undergraduate Research Program (UROP).
It includes code, Colab notebooks, and results from weekly experiments (Week 3 — Week 5). The goal is to reproduce the experiments and compare results side-by-side with the paper.

For side by side comparisons:
See experiment-utils/compare_results.ipynb for code to create comparison tables and plots. The notebook loads results/*.json saved by the experiments and a small YAML/JSON file with paper results to generate a single comparison table and plots.
